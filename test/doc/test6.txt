The kernel is critical to a computer's operation, and it requires careful protection within the system's memory. The kernel space it loads into is a protected area of memory. That protected memory space ensures other applications and data don't overwrite or impair the kernel, causing performance problems, instability or other negative consequences. Instead, applications are loaded and executed in a generally available user memory space.
