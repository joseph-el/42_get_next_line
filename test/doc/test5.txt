Scheduling and management
are central to the kernel's
operation. Computer hardware
can only do one thing at a time.
However, a computer's OS
components and applications
can spawn dozens and even hundreds
of processes that the computer
must host. It's impossible
for all of those processes
to use the computer's hardware --
such as a memory address or CPU instruction pipeline -- at the same time. The kernel is the central manager of these processes. It knows which hardware resources
are available and which processes need them.
It then allocates time for each process to use those resources.
