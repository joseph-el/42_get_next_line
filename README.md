## 💡 About Project
> _This project is writing by two form  1 using linked list 2 using arrays

> _The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line, read from a file descriptor._

	This project make you understand how files open and how read or write on them in an OS,
	also GNL will make u understanding what is system and them relation with your process.
	it will also allow you to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming : static variables.
	This project consists of coding a function that returns one line at a time from a text file.
